\title{Predict using mean model}
\usage{
predict_mean_model(historic_data, future_data, model, model_config = list())
}
\arguments{
\item{historic_data}{A tsibble with historical data (not used by mean model, but kept for interface consistency)}

\item{future_data}{A tsibble with future time periods and locations to predict for}

\item{model}{The trained model object from train_mean_model()}

\item{model_config}{A list containing model configuration options (optional)}
}
\value{
A tsibble with columns: time_period, location, disease_cases (predicted)
}
\description{
Generates predictions by returning the mean disease cases for each location
}
